# Introduction
ytdownloader is a program written in python and it's purpose is to download YouTube videos
# Instructions
## Libraries
```python
$ python -m pip install pytube
```

```python
$ python -m pip install moviepy
```
optional
```python
$ python -m pip install tqdm
```

## Walkthrough
Upon launching the script, you will be met with an input, that wants a YouTube link. After you entered the YouTube link, you will be welcomed by another prompt. This promt serves the purpose of choosing which file you want. If you input 1, you will only download the sound of the video. If you input 2, you will only download the video. If you input 3, you will down both the video, and the sound in a separate mp3 file. The files will be installed in the same directory where the script is launched, so I recommend making a specific folder for ytdownloader.
# Final words
This project was made with the purpose of learning python, and I must say that I am quite amazed with the capabilites of python and programming as a whole. I was never really interested in programming but this project sparked an interest. Thank you for trying out my program, and I hope it helps you in your video downloading shenanigans.
